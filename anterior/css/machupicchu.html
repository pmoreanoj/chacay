				<h2>Cuzco and Macchu Picchu</h2>
				
				<p>For many visitors to Peru and South America, a visit to Cuzco, the Inca capital, with an excursion to the lost Inca city of Machu Picchu, are the breathtaking culmination of their trip. With its spectacular location, it's the best-known archaeological site on the continent. This awe-inspiring ancient city was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century. In the high season from late May until early September, the maximum limit of 2500 people arrive daily. Despite this great tourist influx, the site manages to retain its air of grandeur and mystery, and is a must for all visitors to Latin America.</p><br>

<p>Typical Classic 4 day Inca Trail Trek Itinerary and Trail Description </p><br>

							<img src="images/machupicchu/package1.jpg" class="packages"/>
							
							
								
			  <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Map the the 4 day Inca Trail to Machu PicchuDay 1 (12km): Travellers are collected early from their hotels and travel by bus through the picturesque villages of Chinchero, Urubamba and Ollantaytambo, for the 3½ hour scenic trip to kilometre 82 (the start of the trail). Hikers cross the Vilcanota River and follow the trail to the right as it climbs steeply up from the river. After passing through a small village, the ruins of the Inca hillfort of Huillca Raccay come into view high above the mouth of the river Cusichaca ('happy bridge'). It is a simple descent down to the Cusichaca river. The path follows the left bank of the river up to the village of Wayllabamba (3,000m). The name in Quechua means 'grassy plain'. Most tour groups spend the first night here,  although there are prettier campsites a little further on.<br><br>

                <strong>Day 2 (11km):</strong> Climbing up from Wayllabamba for about 3 hours through steepening woods and increasingly spectacular terrain brings you to the treeline and a meadow known as Llulluchapampa (3,680m). It is another 1½ hours climb to the first and highest pass of the trail (Abra de Huarmihuañusca or 'Dead Woman's Pass) at 4,200m. During this part of the trail hikers are exposed to the Andean elements: first scorching sun and then, closer to the pass, freezing winds. Once at the top hikers can celebrate having completed the most difficult section of the trail. The descent from the pass is steep although not difficult, following the trail on the left side of the valley to the valley floor and to the 2nd night's campsite at Pacamayo (3,600m). There are toilet facilities here.<br><br>

<strong>Day 3 (16km):</strong> From Pacamayo it takes about an hour to climb to the ruins of Runkuracay. These small circular ruins occupy a commanding position overlooking the Pacamayo valley below. Another 45 minute hike will bring you to the top of the second pass: Abra de Runkuracay (4,000m). At last you'll feel that you are walking along the trail of the Incas with paving, for the most part, being original. The descent down the steps from the pass is steep, so take care. This section of the trail, up till the 3rd pass, is particularly beautiful as the path crosses high stone embankments and skirts deep precipices. After about 1 hour from the 2nd pass you'll arrive at Sayacmarca by way of a superbly designed stone staircase. The name Sayacmarca means 'Inaccessible Town' and describes the position of the ruins perfectly, protected on three sides by sheer cliffs. No one knows the exact purpose of these ruins. <br><br>

You have to backtrack a ways to rejoin the trail as it passes Conchamarca, a small Inca dwelling situated in the shadows of Sayacmarca, which was probably a tambo for weary travelers on their way to Machu Picchu. From here on the path descends into a magnificent cloud forest full of orchids, hanging mosses, tree ferns and flowers, passing through an impressive Inca tunnel, carved into the rock, on the way.<br><br>

The trail then climbs up to the 3rd pass (3,700m). The view from the pass offers excellent views of several snow-capped peaks including Salkantay (6,271m) and Veronica (5,750m). A few minutes after the pass is Phuyupatamarca, the most impressive Inca ruin so far. The name means 'Town in the Clouds'. Access to the ruins is down a steep flight of stairs passing six 'Inca Baths' probably used for the ritual worship of water.<br><br>

<img src="images/machupicchu/package3.jpg" class="packages" style="float:right; margin-left:5px;"/>

Leaving the site via an impressive Inca staircase leading from the west side of the ruins (the far end from the baths), you descend a thousand or so steps. Be careful with your knees which will feel the strain by the end of the day.  After about an hour of walking through cloud forest you may just be able to see the tin roof of the Trekkers Hostal at Wiñay Wayna, although it probably won't be for another 2 hours until you arrive.<br><br>

The Trekkers Hostal certainly isn't considered one of Peru's best-looking hotels. It is also usually crowded and cramped, but it is the last official campsite before Machu Picchu, hence it's always full. There is, however, a restaurant where you can purchase food, drinks and even a well deserved beer, as well as hot showers ($1.5) and toilets. Trekkers on the Classic 4-day trek will camp here. The dormitory beds in the hostal used to be used by trekkers doing the shorter Inca Trail trek but trekkers now have to continue directly to Machu Picchu and spend the night at Aguas Calientes. <br><br>

A short trail leaves from the southern end of the hostal to the ruins of Wiñay Wayna. The name in Quechua means 'forever young' and is named after a variety of pink orchid which grows here. The ruins comprise magnificent agricultural terraces set in an impressive location. There are also many buildings of good quality stonework and a sequence of 10 baths, suggesting that the site was probably a religious center associated with the worship of water. Ritual cleansing may have taken place here for pilgrims on the final leg of the trail to Machu Picchu.<br><br>

<strong>Day 4 (6km):</strong> The trail from the hostal to Machu Picchu is clearly marked and takes about 1½ hours. Most people attempt to wake up at 4:30 a.m. so that they can leave Wiñay Wayna by 5.30am to get to Machu Picchu before sunrise. The sky starts getting light by 6am and the first rays of the sun reach Machu Picchu at about 7am. The trail contours a mountainside and drops into the cloud forest before coming to an almost vertical flight of 50 steps leading up to the final pass at Intipunku (Sun Gate). Suddenly, Machu Picchu spread out before you in all its glory, with Huayna Picchu as a backdrop: a spectacular climax of an unforgettable journey.
