				<br><p><em>"This program made for the best summer of my life. It helped me to grow and change; it truly was a metamorphosis for me.  The various experiences pushed my comfort zone yet I always felt safe. 
David and Kristen planned this program perfectly. We were able to see most of the country of Ecuador. I really enjoyed the natural beauty; from the magnificent volcano Cotopaxi to the exotic jungle, it was amazing. 
Some of the experiences were a total adventure. Where else can you climb a 250 ft. high tower above the tree tops of the jungle, ride in a cable car far above the canopy, and bike through a forest continually covered in clouds? 
I would highly recommend going on this program."</em><br> <strong>Heidi, Encuentros 2008 participant</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>"Hola!<br>
Some opinions/thoughts from a student who participated in the program (Encuentros 2008):<br>
1. Broad. Diverse program if you want a mixture of language immersion, community service, teamwork skills, and travel.<br>
2. Well chosen program directors: caring, capable, and great resource for students (Lucia is awesome!)<br>
3. Safe. David is a responsible and intelligent director that will make sure students are taken care of Ecuadorian culture will welcome you warmly. A breath of fresh air and eye-opening experience for those who do not travel often.<br>
5. Overall, a great, well-rounded program for high school students who are ready to get out of their comfort zone!<br>
chao for now, Hannita"</em><br> <strong>Hanna, Student at Claremont College, California</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>"Hannah had a truly amazing time in Ecuador with this group of wonderful young people and adult leaders. A truly amazing time. She saw a beautiful country, met wonderful people, made great friends, stretched her body and her mind. She laughed and sang and worked and milked and walked and biked and climbed and dug and rafted and discussed and struggled and learned... She learned about Ecuador, about its people, about its environment, she learned Spanish and she learned a lot about herself. It just doesn't get much better than that!<br>
Thanks to the group, thanks to Lucia and David and the families and everyone who made the 5 weeks so truly amazing!"</em><br> <strong>Katherine, Hannah's mother, New York</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>I value my time spent in Ecuador so much it's hard to find the words to express my thanks. What I saw, did, and generally experienced there are things I will always cherish.  I suppose I'll start by telling you a bit about what we did there. 
Our group got a full dose of Ecuador, skipping no part of the potion. David gave us time in Quito, the orient/jungle, the coast and all that lies in-between. Ecuador is so diverse that it often felt as if we were stepping into a different country as we traveled to a different place. Most predominantly, the people in Ecuador, though their lifestyle and surrounding were so various, all held the same spirit in them. Though they often had so little in possessions, they were more giving than anyone I know and the good atmosphere they created was palpable in their presence. My family in Las Mercedes, the town in which we did our homestays, was so welcoming I immediately felt like family; 2 seconds into their home. At Yachana High School too, where in the US a school of 100 boys tensions would run high, the students were only concerned with having a good time. <br>
Now, while the people of Ecuador are lovely, the place they live in is gorgeous. The jungle seethes with life and the beaches are as beautiful, if not more so, than any we have here. Sitting at the foot of the Andes' mountains one is overwhelmed by their power. So huge and still, yet so moving. I did more traveling by bus during this trip than I have ever done before so I got to see large swaths of the land that way as well. The rolling hills could seem endless at times, with the checkered pattern of small farms on them making it seem as if we were going in circles. We got accustomed to seeing livestock everywhere, though a chicken riding in one of our buses still managed to surprise the group with a squawk. And of course milking a cow was  an enlightening experience for all of us. <br>
I think my favorite part of our travels was the too few nights we spent on the beach. The hostels we stayed in were nice but I couldn't wait to get out of them and out into the surroundings. The energy that life on the coast holds is immediately apparent upon stepping off the bus. From the fish markets to the voracious tourist agents, everything moves with a purpose and appetite. Even the whales, of which there are amazing numbers, seem to be charged with energy. We rode next to one as it breached upwards of 20 times! Naturally I was partial to the ocean itself, which me and Erin (fellow Encuentros member) went on a couple of lengthy swims in. The warm water was irresistible and a shocking blue. I felt like I could stay in forever. The beaches too were awesome and much more alive than the ones we have here in California. There were swarms of crabs running around, live sand dollars to be found in the surf, and cool pieces of coral EVERYWHERE. We even got to go snorkeling off La Isla de Plata and saw all sorts of varieties of fish, coral, and even a ray. The theme of seeing something you'd only catch in a zoo back at home was carried throughout our travels.  I could go on for hours about the fun things there were to see. I have, for instance, been completely desensitized to giant scary spiders. The one's they have there are built like tanks, have big spikes, or can kill quickly with a single bite. I also got to swing on an actual jungle vine! It felt like being Tarzan. The buses are terrifying but it was quite a laugh to see a couple of Jackie Chan movies on one of our rides. Classic globalization. <br>
Now that I'm home I can sit back and see what I learned from this trip. For one, it's nice to have concrete memories of the experiences. These are in comparison to the trips my family made when we were little which just feel like a haze now. I feel that at this age, I can fully appreciate and learn from my experiences. In addition, the trip left me with a feeling of comfort with the world around me. Somehow, trekking around a country with sketchy infrastructure where you can never be exactly sure of what to expect has exorcised me of the fear I would occasionally feel when encountering something new in my day to day life. This has given me a welcome new feeling of independence in and out of my home. Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure what it was but after this summer I have felt much less self-conscious. I no longer give a darn if others think my clothes are funny or who I hang out with is cool. I focus much more now on understanding the why and how of my life and try to be less caught up in the superficial that can so easily take over.<br>
This is all due to you, Tad. I can't thank you enough. Without your help my summer would have been fun, but nothing compared to the unforgettable experience Ecuador pulled out of its pocket. After all, how can lying on a beach compare to riding a zipline 300 feet over a river? </em><br> <strong>Peter, Encuentros 2009, California, age 16</strong>

<p><em>"Hola! Soy Emily and I was a participant on the Encuentros 2008 program and LOVED IT! I had been living in Ecuador for 6 months previously with my amazing host family, the Diaz familiy. I had a wonderful experience going to school in Quito and learning Spanish with the help of my host parents and 3 host siblings! (and of course my loving Uncle David). Despite being in Ecuador for so long, I really only stayed in Quito, so Encuentros was the perfect program for me to see more of the country. I loved the diversity of places, climates, people, and flora/fauna that we got to see. The home stay in Las Mercedes (a super rural village) was a blast! I formed such close bonds with my family and the whole village; it was so neat to really immerse ourselves and it took my Spanish to a whole new level. Not to mention learning how to slaughter a chicken, make cheese, horseback riding, tree-planting, map painting, cow milking, teaching classes on composting! Overall, it was a fabulous experience! " </em><br> <strong>Emily, Santa Cruz, California</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>"As a parent of a child going to Ecuador last summer, I was hesitant at first. As I talked on the phone with Dr. Lansdale, I began to feel comfortable with him as a Director and with the itinerary we received. Dr. Lansdale inspires respect & trust. What an incredible experience it was!! She was safe with people who cared about her and she had many wonderful life-changing experiences! The 10-day home stay in a remote village was a great way to see how the people of Ecuador live. They enjoyed all the wonderful activities... hiking, biking, river rafting, snorkeling, etc. Ecuador is slightly smaller than NV, yet so bio diverse! They visited the coast, the Andes mtn. region and the Amazon jungle! It is a beautiful country! One of the most significant things about Ecuador is the people! They are very warm and friendly! If you have questions, feel free to ask!" </em><br> <strong>Vicki, mother of Katelyn, 2008 participant, Gig Harbor, WA</strong>
</p><br>

<!--p><em>"My daughter Hannah Becker is participating this summer. I am lucky to know the Lansdale family having worked for the American Farm School's NY Office in the 80's. I was the coordinator of the Farm School's Greek Summer program which is the inspiration for David's Ecuador program. My husband and I send our daughter to Ecuador for a month confident that she will be safe and will learn so much. She wants to do something out of her comfort zone, and this will certainly accomplish that! She looks forward to making new friends, immersing herself in a new culture and learning a lot about that culture and herself along the way. Here's to Encuentros: Metamorfosis en Ecuador 2009!" </em><br> <strong>Katharine, mother of Hanna, 2009 participant, Tarrytown, NY</strong>
</p><br-->

<p><em>Summer 2008 is officially over as of this morning with Charlie (and Emily) starting back to school.  We all want to thank you again for the summer you created for Carlitos... He still in thinking of Ecuador each day; and there is no question that his time spend in S. America will influence all of his life..."</em><br> <strong>Helen, mother of Carlitos, participant 2008, Santa Cruz, CA</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>"After being in Ecuador for the program when people ask me about my trip I always am quick to answer with "It was the best experience of my life" Ecuador now holds a very dear and special place in my heart. The land and beauty that the county holds is astounding as well as the people who are so welcoming and sweet. Not only is it a good experience to broaden your horizons but to learn a very fun language and develop better personality skills. It is an experience I will never forget and I am anxious to visit again!"</em><br> <strong>Alyssa, Encuentros 2008 participant</strong>
</p><br>

<p><em>Hey I'm Chase Waldo from Granite Falls, Washington and I just wanted you to know that this is an experience you don't want to miss!  I have a lot of great memories.  Stopping at all the ice cream shops with David, bicycling and traveling in the van.  Meeting and staying with a native family in Ecuador was really neat.  The group of kids in the program made it really interesting and fun.  The tropics are amazing and the people have a different view on life that was good for me to see.  The whole trip was an adventure.  David is a funny easy going guy and kept things moving.  </em><br> <strong>Chase, Granite Bay, Washington, Encuentros 2008 participant</strong>
